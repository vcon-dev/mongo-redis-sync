# Redis to Mongo Sync

A Python script that synchronizes Redis keys (prefixed with `vcon:`) into a MongoDB collection. It can optionally listen to Redis keyspace events to update MongoDB in real time when the keys are changed.

## Features

- **Initial Key Scan**: Scans Redis keys (`vcon:*`) and inserts/updates them in MongoDB.
- **Real-time Updates**: Listens to Redis keyspace notifications to stay in sync whenever Redis keys are created or updated.
- **Configurable**: Uses environment variables (via [python-dotenv](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/)) for easy setup.
- **Logging**: Leveraging Python’s `logging` module for structured logs and error reporting.

---

## Prerequisites

1. **Redis** 7.x or later (with [Keyspace Notifications](https://redis.io/docs/manual/keyspace-notifications/) enabled)  
2. **MongoDB** 4.x or later  
3. **Python** 3.9+ (for local runs)  
4. **Docker** (optional, if you wish to run via container)

Make sure Redis is configured to broadcast keyspace notifications, e.g.:

```bash
redis-cli config set notify-keyspace-events ExA
```

---

## Installation

1. **Clone** or download the repository containing this script.
2. **Install** Python dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   The default `requirements.txt` should include:
   ```text
   redis
   pymongo
   python-dotenv
   ```

3. **Create a `.env` file** in the same directory (if one does not already exist). For example:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   Then update the contents as needed.

---

## Configuration

The script reads environment variables from the `.env` file:

```ini
# .env
REDIS_HOST=localhost
REDIS_PORT=6379
REDIS_DB=0

MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017
MONGO_DB=mydatabase
MONGO_COLLECTION=vcon
```

Adjust these values to match your local or production environment. You can also pass them via the command line or other environment injection methods, but `.env` is the simplest for local development.

---

## Usage

1. **Make sure** that both Redis and MongoDB are running and properly configured.
2. **Run the script** from your terminal:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   This will:
   - Perform a one-time scan of the Redis keyspace for `vcon:*` keys and upsert them into MongoDB.
   - Begin listening for keyspace notifications to keep MongoDB in sync with new or updated `vcon:` keys in Redis.

3. **Check the logs** for confirmation messages:

   - Keys found and upserted into MongoDB.
   - Any real-time updates when `vcon:` keys are created or modified.

Use `CTRL+C` or another termination signal to stop the script.

---

## Running via Docker

You can run this script in a Docker container if you prefer:

1. **Create a `Dockerfile`** in your project (an example is below):

   ```dockerfile
   # Use a lightweight Python base image
   FROM python:3.9-slim

   WORKDIR /app

   # Copy requirements to leverage Docker cache
   COPY requirements.txt /app/requirements.txt
   RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

   # Copy your code into the container
   COPY . /app

   # If needed, expose a port (not necessary for a background worker)
   # EXPOSE 8000

   CMD ["python", "main.py"]
   ```

2. **Build** the Docker image:

   ```bash
   docker build -t redis-mongo-sync .
   ```

3. **Run** the container:

   ```bash
   docker run --name sync -d \
     -e REDIS_HOST=your-redis-host \
     -e MONGO_URI=mongodb://your-mongodb:27017 \
     redis-mongo-sync
   ```

   - If you rely on the `.env` file inside your container, ensure it’s copied into the image (as in the Dockerfile example) or mount it at runtime.

Check `docker logs sync` to view the script logs.
